notepad .env
# Add: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

#### 2. Module Not Found
```bash
# Error: ModuleNotFoundError
# Solution: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Permission Denied (Batch Files)
```bash
# Error: batch file won't run
# Solution: Run from PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File calculator.bat
```

#### 4. No Generated Files
```bash
# Check if generated_projects directory exists
ls generated_projects
# If empty, try running again with a simpler prompt
```

## üéØ Best Practices for Prompts

### ‚úÖ Good Prompt Structure
```
1. Start with: "Create a [type] web app..."
2. List specific features with bullet points
3. Mention UI requirements (modern, responsive, beautiful)
4. Include technical requirements (local storage, error handling)
5. End with: "Generate complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files"
```

### ‚ùå Avoid These in Prompts
- Vague descriptions like "make it nice"
- Missing file format requests
- No UI/UX specifications
- Overly complex features for a single app
- No mention of responsiveness

### üåü Pro Tips
- Be specific about colors, themes, animations
- Mention mobile responsiveness
- Include error handling requirements
- Ask for local storage if data persistence needed
- Request keyboard shortcuts for better UX

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Setup (one-time)
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Generate apps (with satisfaction checking)
python app_prompts.py calculator

# 3. Or use batch files
calculator.bat

# 4. Check generated files
ls generated_projects
```

## üéä What Happens When You Run

1. **AI Generation**: Multi-agent system creates your app
2. **File Creation**: HTML, CSS, JS files saved to `generated_projects/`
3. **Satisfaction Check**: System asks if you're satisfied
4. **Gemini Editing**: If not satisfied, describe improvements
5. **Iterative Loop**: Keeps improving until you're happy
6. **Final Result**: Complete web app ready to use

## üìÅ Output Structure
```
