## 🎯 How to Run the Project (3 Methods)

### Method 1: Pre-built Apps with Satisfaction Checking ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```bash
# Generate specific apps with detailed prompts
python app_prompts.py calculator
python app_prompts.py todo
python app_prompts.py grades
python app_prompts.py quiz
python app_prompts.py age
```

**What happens:**
1. 🤖 AI generates beautiful app with detailed prompts
2. 📁 Files saved to `generated_projects/app_[timestamp]/`
3. 🤔 System asks: "Are you satisfied? (y/n)"
4. 😊 If YES → ✅ SATISFIED - Done!
5. 🔧 If NO → Describe improvements → Gemini edits → Repeat

### Method 2: One-Click Generation (Windows)

```bash
# Just double-click or run these batch files:
calculator.bat
todo.bat
grades.bat
quiz.bat
age.bat
```

### Method 3: Custom Prompts (Advanced)

```bash
python main.py
# When prompted, enter your custom prompt
```
